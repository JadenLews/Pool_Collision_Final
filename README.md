# 2D Pool Game Simulator

This project is a **2D pool game simulator** built using the Processing web based environment. It was made to model realistic pool ball interactions, including collision physics, rebounds, and shot validation logic. All using custom math and physics calculations.

## Features

- **Physics Based Ball Movement**
  - Simulates real time motion and collisions of balls on a pool table
  - Uses 2D vector math to calculate direction, speed, and rebound angles

- **Collision Detection and Response**
  - Custom physics to handle ball to ball and ball to wall collisions
  - Conservation of momentum and angle logic

- **Shot Validation**
  - Determines whether a shot is valid based on pool rules (hitting the cue ball first, collisions, ball pocketing)
  - Manages turn logic

- **Visual Interface**
  - Draws a pool table and renders ball positions and paths dynamically using Processing
  - Animates shots and ball movement smoothly

## Technologies Used

- **Processing (Java)** — browser based IDE and visual programming environment
- **2D Geometry** — trigonometry, vector math, collision math
- **Custom Physics Engine** — no third party libraries used for simulation

## What I Learned

- How to build a realt ime physics engine from scratch
- Implementing trigonometric functions to simulate angles, rebounds, and velocity
- Object oriented design for interactive game components
- Debugging visual simulations and testing game logic

---

## Future Improvements

- Add scoring system and rule enforcement for a full game
- Sound effects and visual polish (ball shadows, friction)
- Mobile/web compatibility for broad access

---

## Status

**Completed Prototype:** Functional simulation showcasing ball movement and physics, with core logic implemented. Not fully gamified or polished.
